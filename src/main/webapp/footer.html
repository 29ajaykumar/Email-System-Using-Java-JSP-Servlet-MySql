        <br>	<h3>Gmail has been a service of Google since its beta launched on April 1st, 2004.<br></h3>


        Although the email service was opened to the public in 2007, there was already a lot of typo traffic to one particular web site: Gamil.com.

        The domain is owned by Gamil Design, Inc., a product and graphic design company from North Carolina. The company formed in 1995 but the domain Gamil.com was not registered until 1998.
